# Student-Instructor_Database-Design-_and_Implementation
#This project, creates a database that includes a student table, instructor table, course table, take table,
a stored procedure that returns the names (last and first), the title of the course and the grade of all the students who are enrolled in courses with 3 or more credit hours, 
a function that computes the current time span for which the student has been enrolled in a specific course,
a trigger that inserts a row into a table called updated_grades whenever a grade is updated in the Take table.
